game:
- moving between a title screen, lobby and levels
- grabbing/releasing a gun
- shooting a target
- physics
- stop game when 13s have passed
- implement interesting puppet motions/behaviours
- implement methods to pause/resume the game properly when leaving the VR browser for the Occulus main menu and back

build:
- see what can get optimized in Terser config, given I'm mostly using external lib AFrame's public API
- if ever any assets, would avif compress better than webp?
- can I add a round of etc/ect to compress the ZIP even better?
